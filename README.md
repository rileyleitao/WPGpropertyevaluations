# WPGpropertyevaluations
.md
A tool to accept an individuals address and in return provide them the assessment value of their home.
The tool logs the users email along with address to a google sheet using an API. I used an ajax call from the jQuery library to make this call.
The assessment was from the City of Winnipeg API which I used as rudimentary XML HTTPS request for.
